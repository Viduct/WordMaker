		<hr/>
		<p>
			This website generates made-up words using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a> to learn and duplicate patterns
			seen from existing word lists.  When generating a new word, each letter is picked in sequence.  If we are using a Markov chain of order 4, that
			means that each letter is decided from the 4 letters that appear before it.  To figure out what the next letter should be, the program looks at 
			an existing word list and looks at all of the times that it has seen those 4 letters appear in a row, along with what letter proceeds them.  it
			then randomly picks one of those letters, with letters used more frequently having a higher probability of being picked.
		</p>
		

		<br>
		<h1 class="text-primary text-xs-center">Example</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Suppose the current letters are <b>barn</b>.  We look at our source word list and see the following words have the letters "barn":
				<span class="highlighted-word">barn</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnacle</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnacled</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnacles</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnburner</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barndoor</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barney</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnful</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnstormer</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnyard</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">cowbarn</span>.
				Since the letter "a" occured in 3 out of the 11 words after we saw the letters "barn", that means it has a 3/11, or 27% chance that it 
				gets picked as our next letter.  For simplicity's sake, let's say we randomly chose it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Since we chose "a" for our letter, the previous 4 letters are now <b>arna</b>.  We look at our source word list and see that there are 19 words with "arna",
				including but not limited to:
				<span class="highlighted-word">barnacle</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">carnage</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">carnally</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">carnassial</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">incarnation</span>
				<span class="highlighted-word">reincarnate</span> and so on.
				We only saw the letter "g" once, but that still means that it might be chosen as the next letter.  Let's randomly pick it.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now our previous 4 letters are <b>rnag</b>.  There is only one word with this letter combination in all of our English word list!
				That word is <span class="highlighted-word">carnage</span>.
				That means that the next letter has to be "e".
			</li>


			<li>
				Now our previous 4 letters are <b>nage</b>.  This sequence is seen 52 times total.  For 30 of those instances, it marks the end of the word.
				There is also a chance that we might pick "a", "d", "i", "m", "n", or "r", since those are also seen after "nage".  We'll randomly choose "m",
				which has a 6% chance of getting picked.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now our previous 4 letters are <b>agem</b>.  This sequence is seen 14 times total.  The letter "e" occured 9 times (64%), so let's randomly
				pick it.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now our previous 4 letters are <b>geme</b>.  This sequence is seen 24 times, but the next letter is always "n".  So that will be our next letter.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now our previous 4 letters are <b>emen</b>.  This sequence is very common; it has 235 occurances.  219 of those words have a "t" as the next 
				letter (think of words like <span class="highlighted-word">management</span>).  So let's suppose that "t" is chosen to be next.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now our previous 4 letters are <b>ment</b>.  This sequence is even more common with 698 occurances.  The letter "a" is pretty common 
				(16% chance), but the most common outcome is for the word to end at this point since that happened 465 out of the 698 times.  So we'll end
				the word here.  Our final word is <b><span class="highlighted-word">barnagement</span></b>!
			</li>
			
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>
				We skipped talking about how to get the first 4 letters.  Fortuately it's very simple.  If we don't have 4 letters chosen yet, we look at words
				that start with the letters we do have.  So the first letter will be chosen based on what letters are commonly seen at the start of a word.  The
				second letter will be chosen from all of the words that start with the first letter we chose previously.  The third letter will look at all words
				that start with the first two letters, and so on.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sometimes it happens that we create a word that's actually in our dictionary.  In this case, we just throw it out and start over.
